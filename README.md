## Cellular Network Parameters Investigation

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to explore and analyze cellular network parameters using smartphone service mode.

---

## Device
- Android smartphone (Service Mode)

Service mode was accessed using the device-specific dial code.

---

## Parameters Observed
The following cellular network parameters were investigated:
- Signal strength (RSSI, RSRP)
- Signal quality (SINR, RSRQ)
- Cell ID
- Carrier frequency
- Bandwidth
- Network technology (3G / 4G / LTE / 5G)

---

## Measurement Conditions
Measurements were taken under different conditions:
- Indoors
- Near a window
- At different locations
- Using different network modes when available

Screenshots of the collected data are included in this repository.

---

## Collected Data
The following files contain the recorded measurements:
- `measurement1_lte_debug.jpg`
- `measurement1_phone_info.jpg`
- `measurement2_phone_info.jpg`

These screenshots show the cellular parameters observed during the investigation.

---

## Analysis
Signal strength and signal quality were analyzed to understand their impact on:
- Data speed
- Network stability
- Connectivity reliability

Observed variations were influenced by:
- Distance from the cell tower
- Physical obstructions (walls, buildings)
- Network environment and load

---

## Conclusion
The investigation shows that cellular signal strength and quality vary significantly based on location and environment. Better signal quality generally results in more stable and reliable network performance.
